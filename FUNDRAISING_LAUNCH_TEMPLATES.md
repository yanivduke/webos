## Reddit Post: r/amiga (Fundraising Focus)

**Title:**
```
[Project Update] WebOS Fundraising Campaign - Help Preserve Workbench 3.1
```

**Post:**
```
Hi Amiga community!

A few months ago I shared my Workbench 3.1 recreation project (WebOS). The response was incredible - thank you!

**What's New:**
Since launch, I've added:
✓ Real file operations (create, edit, delete)
✓ Shell terminal with 12+ commands
✓ Paint application with drawing tools
✓ State persistence across sessions
✓ AWML WebAssembly SDK for native apps

**Try it:** [your-url]

**Why I'm Posting:**
I'm now seeking community funding to take WebOS to the next level. The project is and always will be 100% free and open source, but development time isn't free.

**Funding Goal: $2,000**
This will fund:
• Authentic Amiga sound effects (disk clicks, window opens, etc.)
• More system tools (Preferences, MultiView, Clock)
• Keyboard shortcuts (Amiga+M, Amiga+N, etc.)
• Professional documentation
• Hosting costs for 1 year

**How to Support:**
• 💰 GitHub Sponsors: github.com/sponsors/yanivduke (monthly recurring)
• ☕ Ko-fi: ko-fi.com/[username] (one-time)
• ⭐ Star the repo: github.com/yanivduke/webos
• 📣 Share with fellow Amiga enthusiasts

**Sponsor Tiers:**
• $5/month: Bronze - Name in SPONSORS.md
• $10/month: Silver - Name + logo on README
• $25/month: Gold - Early access to features
• $50/month: Platinum - Input on roadmap

**Can't contribute financially?**
You can still help!
• Test and report bugs
• Suggest authentic features
• Share screenshots from real Amigas for reference
• Spread the word

**Transparency:**
All funding and expenses will be publicly documented in FUNDING.md. I believe in radical transparency for community-funded projects.

**Current Status:**
• Raised: $0
• Goal: $2,000
• Timeline: 3-6 months

The Amiga community has kept this platform alive for 40 years. This is my contribution to that legacy.

Every dollar helps preserve computing history. Who's in? 🖥️

Questions? Ask away! I'm here all day.

## Hacker News Update Post

**Title:**
```
WebOS Update: Now seeking community funding to preserve Amiga history
```

**URL:**
```
https://github.com/yanivduke/webos
```

**Text:**
```
A few months ago I shared WebOS here - a pixel-perfect Amiga Workbench 3.1 recreation for browsers. The HN community gave incredible feedback (thank you!).

Since then, I've added:
- Real file operations (was in-memory only)
- Shell terminal with 12+ Unix-style commands
- Paint app with drawing primitives
- Application state persistence
- WebAssembly SDK (AWML) for building native apps

Live demo: [your-url]

**Why this update:**
I'm now seeking $2,000 in community funding to accelerate development. The project is 100% open source (MIT) and always will be free.

Funding will go toward:
- Authentic Amiga sound effects
- More system tools (Preferences, MultiView, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Documentation
- Hosting

GitHub Sponsors: github.com/sponsors/yanivduke
Ko-fi: ko-fi.com/[username]

All funds/expenses will be publicly documented.

**Why I'm doing this:**
The Amiga taught me to code in 1987. This is my thank you note to computing history.

**Technical notes for HN:**
- Vue 3 Composition API (no Pinia/Vuex)
- TypeScript throughout
- Vite build system
- Custom WASM runtime with host API bindings
- Pure CSS (no frameworks - retro requires manual bevels!)
- Express backend for file ops

I'd love feedback from the HN community, especially on:
1. Fundraising strategy for open source
2. WASM runtime architecture
3. What retro OS to build next (Windows 3.1? Mac System 7?)

Open to questions!

# Funding Open Source: Raising $2K to Preserve Amiga History

Three months ago, I launched WebOS - a pixel-perfect recreation of the Amiga Workbench 3.1 interface for modern browsers. Today, I'm asking for your help to take it further.

## Try It First
- Live demo: [your-url]
- GitHub: https://github.com/yanivduke/webos

## The Journey So Far

I spent 300+ hours recreating every detail of the Amiga Workbench:
- The exact #a0a0a0 gray background
- Beveled window borders (2px, #ffffff top/left, #000000 bottom/right)
- Press Start 2P font (closest to Topaz)
- Draggable/resizable windows
- Working applications
- WebAssembly SDK for native apps

**Tech stack:**
- Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Vite
- WebAssembly
- Express.js
- Pure CSS (no frameworks!)

**Current features:**
✓ NotePad text editor
✓ Paint application
✓ Calculator
✓ Shell terminal (12+ commands)
✓ Clock utility
✓ File operations (create, edit, delete, rename)
✓ State persistence

## Why I'm Fundraising

### The Problem
Open source is a labor of love, but:
- Hosting costs money
- Development time is unpaid
- Quality documentation takes hours
- Sound assets need licensing
- I want to do this full-time (eventually)

### The Goal: $2,000
This modest goal will fund:
1. **Sound effects** ($500) - Authentic Amiga clicks, beeps, disk sounds
2. **Development time** ($1,000) - 50+ hours for new features
3. **Hosting** ($200) - Vercel Pro for 1 year
4. **Documentation** ($200) - Video tutorials, written guides
5. **Assets** ($100) - Icons, graphics, fonts

### The Promise
- Project stays 100% open source (MIT license)
- Always free to use
- Radical transparency (all expenses public)
- Community-driven roadmap

## How I'm Fundraising

### Platform Strategy
I chose **GitHub Sponsors** as primary because:
- Zero fees (100% to me)
- Integrated with GitHub
- Tax-deductible for US sponsors
- Professional appearance

**Ko-fi** for one-time donations:
- Simple setup
- Lower friction
- Good for "try before subscribe"

**No Patreon** (for now):
- 5-12% fees
- Extra platform to manage
- Less developer-focused

### Tier Structure
I researched similar projects and created these tiers:

**$5/month - Bronze Supporter**
- Name in SPONSORS.md
- Sponsor badge on profile
- Warm fuzzies

**$10/month - Silver Supporter**
- Everything above
- Small logo on README
- Monthly dev updates

**$25/month - Gold Supporter**
- Everything above
- Medium logo on README
- Early access to features (1 week)
- Input on roadmap

**$50/month - Platinum Supporter**
- Everything above
- Large logo on README
- Early access (2 weeks)
- Quarterly video calls
- Feature requests prioritized

**$100+/month - Enterprise**
- Custom benefits
- Dedicated support
- Co-marketing opportunities

### Marketing Strategy
1. **Build in public** - Share progress on Twitter
2. **Content marketing** - This article, for example!
3. **Community engagement** - Reddit (r/amiga, r/retrobattlestations, r/webdev)
4. **Hacker News** - Update post
5. **Product Hunt** - Full launch
6. **Email outreach** - Amiga community sites
7. **GitHub README** - Clear funding section

### Launch Tactics
**Week 1 (Soft Launch):**
- Update README with funding info ✅
- Set up GitHub Sponsors
- Announce to Twitter followers
- Post in 2-3 subreddits

**Week 2 (Public Launch):**
- Hacker News post
- Product Hunt launch
- This DEV.to article
- Reach out to retro computing blogs

**Ongoing:**
- Apply for GitHub Secure Open Source Fund ($10K grant!)
- Corporate sponsor outreach
- Monthly progress updates

## What I'm Learning

### Week 1 Insights
- **Setting up takes time**: GitHub Sponsors approval took 3 days
- **Documentation matters**: People read FUNDING.md before sponsoring
- **Transparency builds trust**: Public expense tracking is key
- **Small tiers work**: Most sponsors choose $5-10/month
- **GitHub stars ≠ sponsors**: 100 stars, 0 sponsors (yet!)

### Challenges
1. **Asking for money feels weird** - I'm a dev, not a salesperson
2. **Imposter syndrome** - "Is my project worth funding?"
3. **Time management** - Marketing takes time from coding
4. **Expectations** - What do sponsors expect?

### Lessons
1. **Just ask** - People WANT to support good projects
2. **Show, don't tell** - Live demo > screenshots
3. **Tell a story** - Nostalgia is powerful
4. **Be specific** - "$2K for X features" > "support development"
5. **Offer value** - Even small perks matter

## The Math

### Conservative Scenario (6 months)
- 10 sponsors @ $5/month = $50/month = $300
- 5 sponsors @ $10/month = $50/month = $300
- 2 sponsors @ $25/month = $50/month = $300
- One-time donations = $200
- **Total: $1,100** (55% of goal)

### Optimistic Scenario (6 months)
- 20 sponsors @ $5/month = $100/month = $600
- 10 sponsors @ $10/month = $100/month = $600
- 5 sponsors @ $25/month = $125/month = $750
- 1 corporate @ $100/month = $100/month = $600
- One-time donations = $500
- **Total: $3,050** (152% of goal!)

### Reality Check
- Most projects get $0-50/month
- Top 1% get $500+/month
- Median is ~$15/month
- I'd be thrilled with $100/month

## How You Can Help

### Financial Support
- **GitHub Sponsors**: github.com/sponsors/yanivduke

## Questions I'm Asking

If you've funded an open source project:
1. What made you sponsor?
2. What tier did you choose and why?
3. What expectations do you have?
4. How can maintainers improve?

If you're a maintainer:
1. What funding platforms work best?
2. How do you balance coding vs. marketing?
3. What's your conversion rate (visitors → sponsors)?
4. Any tips for a first-timer?

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about WebOS. It's about:
- **Preserving computing history**
- **Proving open source can be sustainable**
- **Teaching retro UI/UX to new generations**
- **Building in public**

If we hit $2,000, I'll:
1. Document the entire journey
2. Share all metrics publicly
3. Create a template for other OSS projects
4. Pay it forward to other maintainers

## Let's Do This Together

The Amiga community kept this platform alive for 40 years through pure passion. Now it's my turn to contribute.

Will you help me preserve this piece of computing history?
