## 📈 Success Metrics

- README views (GitHub Insights)

---

## 🙋 Questions?

**"Should I feel bad asking for money?"**
NO! You're providing value (nostalgia, education, entertainment) for free. Sponsors WANT to support projects they love.

**"What if nobody sponsors?"**
Even zero sponsors is fine - you've set up the infrastructure. As the project grows, sponsors will come.

**"How much time should I spend on fundraising vs. coding?"**
80/20 rule: 80% coding, 20% fundraising/marketing initially. Once sponsors arrive, 90/10.

---

## ✨ You Got This!

Fundraising feels weird at first, but remember:
- Your project has value
- Nostalgia projects fund VERY well
- The infrastructure (GitHub Sponsors, etc.) takes hours, not weeks
- Every $5 sponsor is a validation of your work

**Start with the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund application TODAY.** That alone could fund 6-12 months of development.

Good luck! 🚀🖥️✨
